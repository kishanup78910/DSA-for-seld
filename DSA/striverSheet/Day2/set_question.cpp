// Example 1: Set Operations
// Problem Statement:
// You are given two sets, Set A and Set B, both containing integers. Implement a C++ program to perform the following set operations:

// Union: Compute and print the union of Set A and Set B.
// Intersection: Compute and print the intersection of Set A and Set B.
// Difference: Compute and print the elements present in Set A but not in Set B.
// Symmetric Difference: Compute and print the symmetric difference of Set A and Set B.
// Example 2: Finding Duplicates
// Problem Statement:
// You are given an array of integers. Write a C++ program to find and print all the duplicate elements in the array using a set data structure.

// Example 3: Frequency Count using Set
// Problem Statement:
// You are given an array of integers. Write a C++ program to count the frequency of each element in the array using a set.

// Example 4: Set of Strings
// Problem Statement:
// You are given a list of strings. Write a C++ program to store these strings in a set and then perform operations like finding the number of unique strings and finding the lexicographically smallest and largest string in the set.

// Example 5: Set and Sorting
// Problem Statement:
// You are given a list of integers. Write a C++ program to store these integers in a set and then print them in ascending order.

// Example 6: Set and Binary Search
// Problem Statement:
// You are given a sorted array of integers. Write a C++ program to convert the array into a set and then perform binary search operations to find if a given element is present in the set or not.









// Example 7: Set and Prime Numbers
// Problem Statement:
// Write a C++ program to generate and store all prime numbers up to a given limit 'N' in a set. Implement a function to check if a given number is a prime number or not. Then, print the prime numbers stored in the set.

// Example 8: Set and Anagrams
// Problem Statement:
// You are given a list of strings. Write a C++ program to group anagrams from the list. Two strings are anagrams if they have the same characters but in a different order. Store these groups of anagrams in sets and print them.

// Example 9: Set and Subsequences
// Problem Statement:
// You are given a string. Write a C++ program to generate all possible subsequences of the string and store them in a set. Subsequences are the strings that can be formed by removing some characters (or none) without changing the order of the remaining characters. Print the unique subsequences stored in the set.

// Example 10: Set and Pair Sum
// Problem Statement:
// You are given an array of integers and a target sum. Write a C++ program to find all pairs of integers in the array that add up to the target sum. Store these pairs in a set and print them. Ensure that each pair is stored only once, regardless of the order.

// Example 11: Set and Palindromes
// Problem Statement:
// Write a C++ program to read a list of strings. Store all palindromic strings (strings that read the same backward as forward) in a set. After reading all strings, print the unique palindromes stored in the set.

// Example 12: Set and Powerset
// Problem Statement:
// You are given a set of integers. Write a C++ program to generate all subsets (including the empty set) of the given set and store them in a set of sets. Finally, print the subsets stored in the set.

// Example 13: Set and Largest Subset
// Problem Statement:
// You are given an array of integers. Write a C++ program to find the largest subset of the array such that no two elements in the subset have a common factor other than 1. Store the elements of this subset in a set and print them.

// Example 14: Set and Matrix Operations
// Problem Statement:
// You are given two matrices represented as sets of sets (sets of integers). Write a C++ program to perform matrix addition and multiplication operations using sets. Print the resulting matrices after each operation.
